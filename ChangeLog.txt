v1.0
- Added more fluid control over displayed text, and fixes cases where title wouldn't display as expected.
- Now displays "Loading..." when loading files.
- Added events to PlayerUIBase: PlayCommandExecuted, PauseCommandExecuted, StopCommandExecuted, SeekCommandExecuted and ChangeVolumeExecuted.
- Added events to MpvMediaPlayerHost: MediaFinished and MediaError.
- Merged MediaPlayerWpf and MediaUI, renamed to MediaPlayer.
- You no longer need extended properties to set UI properties, and you can now bind to events.
- Syntax changed to <ui:MediaPlayer><wpf:MediaPlayerHost /></ui:MediaPlayer>, so you always use the same generic UI class and can display various hosts into it.
